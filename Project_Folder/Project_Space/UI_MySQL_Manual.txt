Manual for UI_MySQL
    

UI_MySQL.py file contains three loggers, four Ui classes and eight function classes.

1. Loggers:
    I.      All loggers will be logging information in the format of: "yyyy-mm-dd time - log type log message"
    II.     Admin loggers and Plate info loggers will log all the edit action into log files: "Plate_Info.log" and 
            "Admin_editor.log", which will be located at the same directory as the UI_MySQL.py.
    III.    Error logger will log the error message whenever encountered an unexpected exception, if encountered any 
            issue, please track back to the very first error function that log the error message.

2. UI classes
    I.      All the UI classes are generated by Qt Designer, including in-class function: setUpUI() and retranslateUi(). 
            Asside from the generated function, there's a modding() function added for modding specific behavier, if 
            there's any need to mod any Ui classes, please mod it in modding() function, and make sure to call the modding
            () in the end of setUpUI(). Similarly, when regernating the Ui function, please copy and overwrite classes 
            setUpUI() and retranslateUi(), then call the modding() in the end of setUpUI().
            
            Sample code:
            class Ui_sample(object)
                # generated code
                def setupUi(self, sample):
                ...
                ...
                self.modding()  # always add this line to imply the mod
                # end of generated code

                # generated code
                def retranslateUi(self, sample):
                ...
                
                # function for all the modding 
                def modding(self):
 
    II.     There're four Ui classes for Login (Ui_Login()), Register (Ui_Register()), normal user Info Editor  
            (Ui_Info_Editor()), and Admin user info editor interface.
